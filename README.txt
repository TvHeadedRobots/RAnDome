RAnDome

RAnDome is a Processing Sketch that makes use of the monomic & oscP5
libraries as well as Processing's Perlin noise generator functions to 
produce a generative, random animation using the monome's 8x8 matrix. 
The reason I call the sketch generative is because the value of each
monome row is then fed back into the noise generator inorder to generate
the next rows value. In this way the sketch is self generating and very
random.
